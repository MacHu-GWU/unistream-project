Buffer
==============================================================================


What is Buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buffer is a critical component for producer program. Buffer packs your records into a micro batch in order. Once the number of records, the size of the batch or the time since the first record reach certain threshold, the producer will take it and send to target system. For fault tolerance, the buffer will persist the record immediately to an append-only write-ahead-log (WAL) file on disk.

There are many methods for implementing the WAL persistence layer. In general, if you want to minimize the probability of data loss, performance will be lower, latency will be higher, and costs will also increase.

This library provides couple of different buffer implementations, each with different trade-offs. You can choose the one that best fits your use case.


File Buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This implementation uses local file to store WAL. Everytime the buffer receive a record, it writes the record to the WAL file, and track the number of records and total size in memory. Once the buffer reach certain threshold, it "emit" a batch of records for further processing. However,
